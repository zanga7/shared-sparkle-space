# Security Documentation

## Security Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Completed Security Fixes

#### 1. Database Function Security Hardening
- **Issue**: Database functions were missing `SET search_path TO 'public'` security setting
- **Risk**: SQL injection via search path manipulation
- **Fix**: All database functions now have proper `SET search_path TO 'public'` configuration
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

#### 2. Enhanced Security Logging
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive security event logging
- **Features**:
  - PIN attempt logging with automatic lockout
  - Admin action tracking
  - Token access monitoring
  - Risk level categorization
- **Functions Added**:
  - `log_security_event()` - General security event logging
  - `log_pin_attempt()` - PIN authentication tracking
  - `log_admin_action()` - Administrative action auditing
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

#### 3. OAuth Token Encryption
- **Issue**: OAuth tokens were stored in plaintext
- **Risk**: Token exposure in case of database breach
- **Fix**: All tokens now encrypted with AES-256 using salted keys
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### ⚠️ Manual Configuration Required

The following security issues require manual configuration in your Supabase dashboard:

#### 1. Extension in Public Schema
- **Issue**: Extensions are installed in the public schema
- **Risk**: Potential privilege escalation
- **Action Required**: Move extensions to dedicated schema
- **Link**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0014_extension_in_public

#### 2. Auth OTP Long Expiry
- **Issue**: OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
- **Risk**: Extended window for token exploitation
- **Action Required**: Reduce OTP expiry time in Auth settings
- **Link**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#security

#### 3. Leaked Password Protection Disabled
- **Issue**: Password breach detection is disabled
- **Risk**: Users can use compromised passwords
- **Action Required**: Enable leaked password protection in Auth settings

## Security Best Practices

### Database Security
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- ✅ Proper foreign key constraints
- ✅ Search path injection protection
- ✅ Encrypted sensitive data (OAuth tokens, PINs)

### Authentication Security
- ✅ PIN-based authentication with lockout mechanisms
- ✅ Session management with expiration
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- ⚠️ Enable leaked password protection (manual config needed)

### Authorization
- ✅ Role-based access control (parent/child roles)
- ✅ Family-based data isolation
- ✅ Action-specific permissions (PIN requirements)

### Audit & Monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging
- ✅ Security event tracking
- ✅ Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- ✅ Admin action logging

## Security Monitoring

### Key Security Events Logged
1. **Authentication Events**
   - PIN authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Account lockouts
   - Session management

2. **Data Access Events**
   - OAuth token access/decryption
   - Sensitive data operations
   - Unauthorized access attempts

3. **Administrative Events**
   - User management actions
   - Permission changes
   - Configuration updates

### Incident Response
- All security events are logged to `audit_logs` table
- Failed PIN attempts trigger automatic lockouts
- Unauthorized access attempts are immediately logged
- Risk levels categorized as: low, medium, high

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] CSRF protection via SameSite cookies

### ⚠️ Infrastructure Security (Manual Steps Required)
- [ ] Move extensions from public schema
- [ ] Configure production CORS settings
- [ ] Set up proper backup encryption
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts

## Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
1. **Monthly**: Review audit logs for suspicious activity
2. **Quarterly**: Update security configurations
3. **Annual**: Full security assessment and penetration testing

### Security Updates
- Monitor Supabase security announcements
- Keep dependencies updated
- Regular security scanning of the application
